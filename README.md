Plugin request: [http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/request-vortex-manipulator.323227/](http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/request-vortex-manipulator.323227/), initiator: roracle

We like a challenge :)

## What it is
"Vortex manipulator. Cheap and nasty time travel. Very bad for you. I'm trying to give it up."

Travel like Jack Harkness or River Song from Doctor Who! Have the Vortex Manipulator in your hand, put in your desired location, and GO!

## Dependencies
This plugin utilises the [TARDIS](http://tardisjenkins.duckdns.org:8080/job/TARDIS/) plugin API, so you must have TARDIS installed as well.

## Crafting
Crafting is a little complicated, as it's an advanced piece of technology. Requirements for crafting are (left to right, top row first): stone button, another stone button, glass; clock, gold, compass; iron ingot, iron ingot, iron ingot. Custom graphics for the crafted item and GUI are available as part of the [TARDIS Resource Pack](https://github.com/eccentricdevotion/TARDIS-Resource-Pack).

## Multi-world support
The plugin works with Multiverse (or other multi-word plugin), remembering personally saved locations and allowing for direct teleporting to any available world and coordinate. Also having respect for World Borders (plugin and the 1.8 default if possible). Towny/Faction/WorldGuard/GriefPrevention suport can be enabled via the config.

## Configuration
There are configuration options that allow for energy usage, recharging, and other things. The various features use different levels of energy, while charging is on a timer, gaining so much charge every minute or so.

## GUI
Because the device in the TV show has buttons and a lot of pushing of them, it would be easiest to have a command based system to work with this - though for hardcore role players, a GUI is provided as well.
